"Active Directory (AD) vs LDAP","Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used to manage computers and other devices on a network. It is a primary feature of Windows Server, an operating system that runs both local and Internet-based servers. Active Directory allows network administrators to create and manage domains, users, and objects within a network. For example, an admin can create a group of users and give them specific access privileges to certain directories on the server. As a network grows, Active Directory provides a way to organize a large number of users into logical groups and subgroups, while providing access control at each level. \nIf you want to make directory information available over the Internet, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the way to do it. LDAP is a streamlined version of an earlier directory standard called X.500. What makes LDAP so useful is that it works great over TCP/IP networks (unlike X.500), so information can be accessed through LDAP by anyone with an Internet connection. It is also an open protocol, which means directories can be stored on any type of machine (i.e. Windows 2000, Red Hat Linux, Mac OS X)."
"Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)","Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used for mapping an Internet Protocol (IP) address to a computer connected to a local network LAN. Since each computer has a unique physical address called a MAC address, the ARP converts the IP address to the MAC address. This ensures each computer has a unique network identification."
"Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)","An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a set of stealthy and continuous computer hacking processes, often orchestrated by a person or persons targeting a specific entity."
"ASCII vs Unicode","ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). By standardization the values used to represent written text, ASCII enables computers to exchange information. Low ASCII code consists of 128 7-bit combinations. This addresses alphanumeric characters and some unprintable characters. High ASCII (extended ASCII) code consists of 128 8-bit combinations of non-alphanumeric characters. This gives ASCII a total of 256 characters: alphanumeric, unprintable, and non-alphanumeric.\nUnicode is a computer standard for encoding characters where each character is represented by sixteen bits. Whereas ASCII, being an 8-bit encoding scheme, can only represent 256 characters, Unicode has 65,536 combinations, enabling it to encode the letters of all written languages as well as thousands of characters in languages such as Japanese and Chinese." 
"BIOS/CMOS/UEFI","BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. These are instructions on a chip in PC-based computers (firmware). The BIOS has several functions. First it is responsible for testing the hardware connected to the system to make sure it is all working correctly. It also contains a number of settings for how the system interacts with its hardware. Primary to this is what device will be used to boot the system (boot order). Once identified, the BIOS hands off the boot sequence to that device.\nThe BIOS is also where a user can set the date and time on the computer, even though that “clock” is actually a separate chip known as the Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS). The long definition can be confusing, but as it applies to a computer, this chip acts as the system clock and draws very little power; requiring only a small battery and can last for years.\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), is an interface that loads near the beginning of the boot sequence and provides custom configuration options for a PC. It is considered the successor to BIOS and offers many advantages, including mouse support, a graphical user interface, and support for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. UEFI is a standardized version of the original Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specification developed by Intel."
"Blockchain","A blockchain is a digital record of transactions. The name comes from its structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain. Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications.\nEach transaction added to a blockchain is validated by multiple computers on the Internet. These systems, which are configured to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions, form a peer-to-peer network. They work together to ensure each transaction is valid before it is added to the blockchain. This decentralized network of computers ensures a single system cannot add invalid blocks to the chain."
"Bluetooth","Bluetooth is a wireless technology for transferring data over short distances. It is ideal for wireless mice, keyboards, and speakers." 
"Bourne Again Shell (BASH) vs Shell (SH)","Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) is named after Stephen Bourne, the creator of the Unix Sell (SH). It is a command language interpreter derived from SH that can execute commands entered at a command prompt and process text file input.\nShell (SH) is a command-line interface, which means it is soley text-based. The user can type commands to perform functions such as run programs, open and browse directories, and view processes that are  currently running. Since  the shell is only one layer above the operating system, you can perform operations that are not always possible using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)."
"Carved File","A file that is extracted without the assistance of the file system. This can be extracted from network traffic, slack/unallocated space, or other locations that would have the file with the header information needed to identify it."
"CIFS vs Samba vs SMB","Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a standard file system designed for sharing files over the Internet. It is part of the SMB protocol.\nSamba is an open-source software implementation of the SMB networking protocol used by Windows computers.\nServer Message Block (SMB) is a network protocol used by Windows-based computers that allows systems within the same network to share files."
"Cluster/Sector","A cluster is the smallest allocated area on a piece of storage media. A cluster is an area of computer storage made up of sectors. A cluster can be the same size as a sector (think floppy disk), but most of the time is much larger. On computers we do not write to sectors, we write to clusters.\nA sector is the smallest writeable area on a piece of storage media. For most of the last three decades, a sector was 512 bytes. These days, larger hard drive sizes are increasing the size of a sector."
"Consent (Legal Authority)","In legal authority, consent is the allowance to perform analysis, extraction or otherwise within the boundaries of the law, as long as the person consenting is the correct party to provide permission for the entirety of the expected reach. For example, a network administrator cannot consent to providing all of the contents of a client’s email, or an entire company’s email."
"Cookie","A small text file used by websites to track a user’s activity on that site or related sites. In some instances, the information the cookie gathers is strictly behind the scenes and not noticed by the user. In other instances, the cookie may track what a person purchased on a site. Upon accessing that website a second time, the site may ask if you want to purchase a similar item based off of the last visit you made."
"DoS/DDoS","A Denial of Service (DoS) attack  is an effort to make one or  more computer systems unavailable.\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack tells all coordinated systems to send a stream of requests to a specific server at the same time."
"Database(s)","A database is a data structure that stores organized information."
"SQL vs Not SQL","Structured Query Language (SQL), pronounced as either 'see-quel' or 'S-Q-L', is a query language used for accessing and modifying information in a database. Some common SQL commands include 'insert,' 'update,' and 'delete.'\nThough SQL is now considered to be a standard language, there are still a number of variations of it, such as mSQL and mySQL." 
"Deleted vs Forensically Wiped File","A deleted file is a file that has been removed from the view of a normal user. When a file is deleted in a File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, the first character of the file name within the directory is changed to a hexadecimal E5, a character unrecognized by the Windows Operating System. The FAT is changed to show that the clusters once allocated to the file are marked available for data. The actual data is not changed at that time and may be found until the data is overwritten. In an NTFS file system, the file is marked for deletion in the Master File Table (MFT), but as with FAT file systems, the data is still retrievable until overwritten.\nA forensically wiped file is one that is overwritten with known data in order to remove the file in its entirety from that specific location."
"Digital Forensics","Digital Forensics is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery, analysis, and reporting of material found in digital devices, such as hard drives, removable drives, i.e. flash drives and SD cards, and optical media."
"DMG (Apple Disk Image) vs MSI vs ISO vs APK vs IPA","A DMG file is a mountable disk image created in Mac OS X.\nAn MSI file is a package that contains installation information for a particular installer, such as files to be installed and installation locations. It may be used for Windows updates as well as third-party software installers.\nAn ISO file is a common CD or DVD disc image format based on the ISO-9660 standard. It contains an exact duplicate of data from the original disc.\nAn APK file is an app created for Android, Google's mobile operating system.\nAn IPA file is a program written for Apple iOS devices such as iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad."
"Domain Name Service (DNS) vs Dynamic DNS","Domain Name System (DNS) are used to resolve hostnames to IP Addresses, i.e., yahoo.com resolves to 206.190.36.45.\nDynamic DNS (DDNS or DynDNS) is a method of automatically updating a name server in the DNS, often in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information." 
"Encryption","Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. It is based off of the use of a key to lock and unlock the data."
"Whole Disk vs File","Whole Disk encryption uses disk encryption software or hardware to encrypt every bit of data that goes on a disk or disk volume.\nFile encryption focuses merely on encrypting the individual file."
"Asymmetric vs Symmetric","Asymmetric encryption utilizes pairs of keys, public and private, that can be used in securing files in communications to a specific recipient and creating signatures in order to verify a sender. Public keys can be distributed openly and anyone can send to the specific individual by using the public key to encrypt the message. Private keys used to decrypt must be protected.\nSymmetric keys are when a singular key is utilized to encrypt data. The unencrypted data is accessible to anyone knows the key and as access to the data of interest."
"Endian","Endianness refers to the sequential order in which bytes are arranged into larger numerical values when stored in memory or when transmitted over digital links. Endianness is of interest in computer science because two conflicting and incompatible formats are in common use: words may be represented in big-endian or little-endian format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are ordered from the big end (most significant bit) or the little end (least significant bit)."
"Entropy","Entropy refers to a lack of order or predictability, an increase of randomness in file contents or input in the realm of Computer Science.\nLow Entropy is when the majority of the file is human readable.\nHigh Entropy demonstrates a more evenly distributed array of character use e.g. increased randomness." 
"EXIF","Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) is a standard that specifies how information is stored in some picture formats, i.e. JPG and TIFF, as well as some uncompressed audio formats, such as RIFF and WAV files. Typical uses of the EXIF standard exist in JPG pictures from digital cameras. Some of the information that can be found in digital pictures is the date and time a picture was taken, camera name, serial number, focus and GPS information."
"File Signature vs. File Extension","A file signature is situated at the beginning of the content in some files, but not all files. JPG pictures, MPG movies, and ZIP files all have identifiable signatures. Another term for signature is header. The signature can be a couple of bytes or a large number of bytes, for example, one type of JPG picture has the signature of \xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0\x01.\nMost files also have extensions. The file extension is the three-character string after the period in a file’s name, i.e., tiger.jpg.\nThe forensic significance is that someone could rename a .jpg picture extension to a .txt file extension. Windows would then show a small text file icon next to the file name. This change in extension does not change the file’s content, but may fool someone into believing that the image file is actually a text file."
"File Systems (NTFS/HFS/APFS/ZFS/exFAT/CDFS)","New Technology File System (NTFS) is a file system introduced by Microsoft with Windows NT and is supported by subsequent versions of Windows\nHierarchical File System (HFS) is the file system used for organizing files on a Macintosh hard disk.\nApple File System (APFS) is a file system developed by Apple specifically for flash memory storage devices.\nZ File System (ZFS) is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). ZFS is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, efficient data compression, integration of the concepts of file system and volume management, snapshots and copy-on- write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured. The only file system to be available open source.\nExtended File Allocation Table (exFAT) is a proprietary Microsoft file system optimized for flash memory. exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution, yet the file size limit of the standard FAT32 file system (i.e. 4 GiB) remains in those scenarios.\nCompact Disc File System (CDFS) is a file system used for storing data on CDs."
"FISA","The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) prescribes procedures for requesting  judicial authorization for electronic surveillance and physical search of persons engaged in espionage or international terrorism against the United States on behalf of a foreign power."
"FISA 702","Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes the Intelligence Community to target the communications of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes."
"Flash Media/Storage","The data is saved to an electronic chip, or series of chips, instead of a set of magnetically coated disks (hard drive). Flash storage has no moving parts, which allows for very quick saving and accessing of files."
"USB/SD Card","A Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive is an electronic storage device. The data is saved to an electronic chip, or series of chips, instead of a set of magnetically coated disks (hard drive). A flash drive has no moving parts, which allows for very quick saving and accessing of files.\nSecure Digital (SD) is a type of memory card used for storing data in devices such as digital cameras, PDAs, mobile phones, portable music players, and digital voice recorders. The card is one of the smaller memory card formats, measuring 24mm wide by 32mm long and is just 2.1mm thick. To give the cards some orientation, the top-right corner of each SD card is slanted."
"Forensically Prepared Media","This refers to a piece of media (hard drive, thumb drive) that is ready to accept a forensic image for processing. This “target” drive is wiped with an identifiable character. By wipe, we mean all of the data on the drive is completely overwritten by that identifiable character.\nIn the early days of forensics, wiping a hard drive was necessary because examiners often worked off of clones of the original drive. Wiping prevented the inadvertent analysis of old data. In modern times, examiners forensically image media. This is an encapsulated format. Analysis of these images is limited to the image itself, not any data outside of the image. Therefore, while wiping is not really necessary from a forensic point of view, we continue to do it as a matter of policy."
"Format","The process by which a piece of magnetic storage, such as a hard drive or a flash drive, is structured to accept data. This process consists of creating a volume boot record, or VBR, setting up a directory structure and noting how many sectors are on the piece of media and grouping them into clusters."
"Free or Unallocated Space","Free space, also known as unallocated space, is that space within a partition that has been formatted and is not currently holding a valid or allocated file. Unallocated space may contain the remnants of deleted files or entire files that have been deleted. It can also contain very little deleted data, depending on how new the drive is."
"Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)/Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)","Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) and Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) are synonymous. A GUID is a 128-bit (16 byte) number used by software programs to uniquely identify the location of a data object. GUIDs are typically written in hexadecimal notation, containing 32 digits, and may look something like this: {12345678-9012-3456-7890-123456789012}"
"GREP/SED/AWK","Global Regular Expression Parser (GREP) is a command-line utility for Unix used for searching text documents. It can perform basic searches and advanced pattern matching using regular expressions.\nStream Editor (SED) is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), SED works by making only one pass over the input(s) and is consequently more efficient.\nAho, Weinberger, Kernighan (AWK) is a pattern scanning language. The basic function of AWK is to search files for lines (or other units of text) that contain a pattern. When a line matches, AWK performs a specified action on that line." 
"Hardware vs Software Write-Protection","Hardware Write-Protection is when a device is connected in-between the forensic imaging computer and the source media that prevents any changes to the source media.\nSoftware Write-Protection is when a software program running on a computer prevents any changes to a piece of source media, such as a hard drive or flash drive."
"Hashing (MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256)","Hashes are mathematical algorithms used in computer forensics to 'digitally fingerprint' a file or forensic image.\nMD5 – Message Digest 5\nA 128-bit (16-byte) algorithm typically displayed in a 32-character alphanumeric string. The chances of two pieces of different data having the same MD5 hash value is 1/(2^128) or 340 billion billion billion billion. The MD5 algorithm has been broken in the lab; however, for forensic purposes, it is still acceptable to use.\nSHA1 – Secure Hash Algorithm\nA 160-bit (20-byte) algorithm typically displayed in a 40-character alphanumeric string. The chances of two pieces of different data having the same SHA1 hash value is 1/(2^160), much less chance than an MD5 hash. The SHA1 algorithm has also been broken in the lab; however, is still considered a viable fingerprinting method for digital data.\nSHA256 – Secure Hash Algorithm\nPart of the SHA2 family. A 256-bit (32-bytes) algorithm, it is typically displayed in a 64-charactere alphanumeric string. The chances of two pieces of different data having the same SHA256 hash value is 1/(2^256), much less chance than either MD5 or SHA1."
"HDD vs SSD","A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is often used interchangeably with the terms 'hard drive' and 'hard disk.' HDDs are non-volatile, meaning they do not need electrical power to maintain their data. They store data magnetically using a series of spinning platters, or magnetic discs, which record individual bits as ones and zeroes.\nA Solid State Drive (SSD) is a type of mass storage device similar to a hard disk drive (HDD). Instead of storing data on magnetic platters, SSDs store data using flash memory."
"IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)","International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a number assigned to a cell phone that uniquely identifies it. Like a serial number, the 15-digit number is divided into four sets."
"Indicators of Compromise (IOC)","Indicator of Compromise (IOC) in computer forensics is an artifact observed on a network or in an operating system that with high confidence indicates a computer intrusion. Typical IOCs are virus signatures and IP addresses, MD5 hashes of malware files, or URLs or domain names of botnet command and control servers."
"Internet","The Internet is a vast, world-wide infrastructure of interconnected computers. Originally designed by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Its purpose was to create a global network of computers with fault-tolerance; the goal being that if one communication line was cut, the computers could route through other computers.\nThe Internet known today is primarily centered on the World Wide Web; however, initially one of the biggest uses for the Internet was email and file transfers. The military and universities were the two primary user groups.\nThe Internet is a global wide area network that connects computer systems across the world."
"Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)/Intrusion Detection System (IDS)","An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security system designed to prevent malicious activity within a network.\nAn Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity."
"IP Address","An Internet Protocol (IP) Address is a series of numbers divided into four octets that uniquely identifies a computer on a network (including the internet). Each octet can be one, two or three numbers, as long as those numbers are within the set of 0-255 and follow the rules needed for the desired behavior." 
"DHCP vs Static","A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) IP address is one that is assigned to a computer from a pool of IP addresses owned by a particular company. Once the user logs off their computer the IP address can be re-assigned to another computer. When the first user logs back on their computer will obtain another address from the pool of unassigned addresses.\nA Static IP address is one that is permanently assigned to a computer and does not change when a user logs off of their computer."
"LAMP/WAMP/XAMPP","Linux – Apache – MySQL – PHP (LAMP) is an archetypal model of web service stacks, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components (Linux - operating system, Apache - web server, MySQL - database, and PHP - software language). The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original selection. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web applications.\nWindows – Apache – MySQL – PHP (WAMP) is another archetypal model of web service stacks similar as the above, but interchanges Windows for Linux (Windows - operating system, Apache - web server, MySQL - database, and PHP - software language).\nCrossPlatform–Apache–MariaDB–PHP–Perl (XAMPP) is a free and open source Cross- platform (X) web server solution stack package consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages."
"LAN/WAN","A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network of connected devices that exist within a specific location. LANs may be found in homes, offices, educational institutions, or other areas. A LAN may be wired, wireless, or a combination of the two.\nA Wide Area Network (WAN) is similar to a LAN, but it is a lot bigger. Unlike LANs, WANs are not limited to a single location, but span long distances via telephone lines, fiber optic cables, or satellite links. They can also be composed of smaller LANs that are interconnected. The Internet could be described as the biggest WAN in the world." 
"MAC Address","A Media Access Control (MAC) Address is a unique set of alphanumeric numbers physically assigned to a network interface card within a computer or other network-capable device, such as a printer. This value, represented by six sets of hexadecimal numbers, identifies the manufacture of the network card (the first three sets of characters) followed by the individual card’s serial number (the second set of three characters)."
"National Security Letter (NSL)","A National Security Letter (NSL) is an administrative subpoena issued by the United States government to gather information for national security purposes. NSLs do not require prior approval from a judge."
"Network Address Translation (NAT)","Network Address Translation (NAT) translates the IP addresses of computers in a local network to a single IP address."
"Network Interface Card (NIC)","A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a physical electronic component in a computer or other network-connected device that allows communication with other devices over a network. The NIC has a MAC Address that uniquely identifies it from other devices on the network."
"Networked Attached Storage (NAS)/Network Drive","By using Networked Attached Storage (NAS), computers can store and access data using a centralized storage location. Instead of each computer sharing its own files, the shared data is stored on a single NAS server. This provides a simpler and more reliable way of sharing files on a network.\nNetwork Drives are hard drives on a computer that are shared onto the network, but if that computer is disconnected from the network, its files will not be available to the other systems."
"Operating System (OS)","An Operating System (OS), is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function." 
"Packers/Obfuscation","Packers is usually a short name for 'runtime packers' and are also known as 'self-extracting archives.' Packers is software that unpacks itself in memory when the 'packed file' is executed. Sometimes this technique is also called 'executable compression.'\nObfuscation are techniques used to conceal or obscure message transmissions or techniques in malware, similar to packers, encryption, and increase of entropy."
"Partition (Primary vs Extended)","A primary partition is a formatted section of a piece of media, such as a hard drive or flash drive, which can store data. There can be up to four primary partitions on a piece of media, or three primary and one extended partition. Primary partitions can be bootable, but there can be only one bootable partition at a time on a piece of media.\nAn extended partition is actually a placeholder on a piece of media that is used to store the location of additional volumes on a piece of media. It does not itself get a drive letter, but can hold up to 23 partitions with drive letters assigned. Drive A and B are reserved letters and C is assigned to the primary partition."
"Partition Tables (GPT/MFT)","The GUID Partition Table (GPT) is the format used to define the hard disk partitions in computers with UEFI startup firmware. GPT replaces the previous Master Boot Record (MBR) method. While the MBR supported partitions as large as 2.2TB, GPT partitions can be up to 18 exabytes.\nThe Master File Table (MFT) is the directory of an NTFS-formatted file system. In the MFT, every file and folder is considered a file, including the MFT. Records within the MFT are 1024 bytes in length. A file’s attributes are present in the MFT and in some cases the entire file, if small enough, can fit entirely into the MFT."
"Peer to Peer (P2P) Sharing","Peer to Peer (P2P) is file sharing over the Internet. This method for sharing files does not incorporate a centralized server containing the files; rather the users themselves have the listing for which users are hosting particular files. This model has been somewhat effective in avoiding federal laws covering the sharing of copyrighted data.\nP2P sharing incorporates the “swarming downloads” method for obtaining files. This means that users can search across a particular P2P network, such as Ares, for files of interest and can download pieces of that file from different computers. This greatly speeds up the downloading of that file and eases the load on any one particular computer."
"Physical Drive vs. Logical Drive","A physical drive refers to the actual drive itself and all of the available sectors on it, starting at sector 0, and running through the last sector on the drive. In most instances, forensic examiners will create a forensic image of a physical drive. This forensic image will contain areas outside of any logical drive, also known as un-partitioned or unused space.\nA logical drive (aka partition or volume) is an area on the physical drive formatted to store data. The logical drive may contain clusters not currently assigned to a file, which is known as unallocated space. This space would be included in a forensic image of a logical drive. Unused space would not be collected in a forensic image of a logical drive."
"Plist","A Property List (PLIST) file is a settings file, also known as a 'properties file,' used by macOS applications to store serialized objects. It contains properties and configuration settings for various programs. PLIST files are formatted in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and based on Apple's Core Foundation Document Type Definition (DTD). It uses the filename extension \n.plist, and thus is often referred to as a p-list file."
"Prefetch File","A Prefetch file is part of the Windows OS and stores how many times a program was run and the last time it was run. In some instances, it may contain the names of the files the program opened. This occurs if a file is opened within ten seconds of the start of the program.\nA Prefetch file helps the operating system run programs more efficiently. Files that have been run more often are moved to the outside of the hard drive tracks so they will open faster."
"RAID","Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, now widely known as Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), is made up of two or more hard drives used together to increase the size of an allocated volume (all RAID types, except 1) and increase the speed of writing data (RAID 0, striping), add redundancy (RAID 1, mirroring), or add fault-tolerance (RAID 5, stripping with parity.) For RAID 5, at least three hard drives are required. There are additional RAID types as well, but the three listed are the most common." 
"RAM vs ROM","Random Access Memory (RAM) is the memory available to a user when the computer is turned on and running. This memory is plugged into slots on the computer’s motherboard. This is the memory that dictates how many programs you can be using at one time. The more RAM the more programs you can have open at one time. When the computer is turned off, this memory will eventually dissipate from the memory chips.\nRead-Only Memory (ROM) is a chip or chips on the computer motherboard that basically contains instructions telling the computer how to operate. This memory never goes away, even when the computer is turned off; however, the computer user cannot change it."
"Registry","The Registry is a place in the Windows Operating System that contains a large number of settings for how the computer operates and interacts with software. Additionally, it tracks user activity, software history, and externally attached devices, such as USB drive. It is actually made up of five different parts: SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, SAM, SECURITY, and NTUSER.DAT. NTUSER.DAT is assigned to each user account on a computer starting with Windows XP."
"Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)","Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) makes it possible to view another computer's desktop on your computer."
"Search Warrant vs. Grand Jury Subpoena vs 2703(d) (Electronic)","For Digital  Media, a Search Warrant (under the authority of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 41) can be used to obtain the full contents of any private messages, posts, or other activity or records, related to a subject’s network account.\nA Grand Jury Subpoena is a compulsory process used to compel the disclosure of records and other information relevant to an authorized investigation. This is ultimately the data about the contents of the search warrant, not the content itself.\nA 2703(d) Court Order authorizes the government to compel disclosure from a provider of stored contents of a wire or electronic communication and records or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer. This is a middle ground of a Search Warrant and a subpoena." 
"Secure Shell (SSH) and Telnet","Secure Shell (SSH) is a method of securely communicating with another computer. The 'secure' part of the name means that all data sent via an SSH connection is encrypted.\nTelnet is a program that allows you log in to a Unix computer via a text-based interface and the communications are not encrypted."
"SIEM","Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware."
"Slack Space","In simple terms, slack space is the area of the end of the logical file to the end of the nearest cluster. This space is divided into two types of slack – RAM Slack and File Slack.\nRAM Slack – This is the area from the end of the logical file to the end of the nearest sector. It can be anywhere from 1 byte to 511 bytes. Prior to Windows 95B, this area was padded with data taken from RAM. It could contain remnants of files and even passwords. In today’s world it contains only hexadecimal zeros.\nFile Slack – This is the area from the end of the sector listed above to the end of the cluster. This space can contain data from deleted files, which can be found using keyword searches."
"SSL/TLS","Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a secure protocol developed for sending information securely over the Internet.\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating computer applications."
"TCP/UDP/ICMP","Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a fundamental protocol within the Internet protocol suite. When data is sent over a TCP connection, the protocol divides it into individually numbered packets or 'segments.' Each packet includes a header that defines the source and destination and a data section.\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) is part of the TCP/IP suite of protocols used for data transferring. UDP is a known as a 'stateless' protocol, meaning it doesn't acknowledge that the packets being sent have been received.\nWhen information is transferred over the Internet, computer systems send and receive data using the TCP/IP protocol. If there is a problem with the connection, error and status messages regarding the connection are sent using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which is part of the Internet protocol."
"T-III ELSUR vs PRTT","Title III Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) is the non-consensual electronic collection of information (usually communications) under circumstances in which the parties have a reasonable expectation of privacy and court orders or warrants are required.\nPen Register/Trap and Trace (PRTT) devices enable the prospective collection of non-content traffic information associated with wire and electronic communications, such as phone numbers dialed from or to a particular telephone or the IP address of communications on the Internet and other computer networks. This is like net flow data in lieu of full packet capture."
"TOR","The Onion Router (TOR) directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis.\nRelay, Exit, and Bridge node TOR relays are also referred to as 'routers' or 'nodes.' They receive traffic on the TOR network and pass it along.\nAn exit relay is the final relay that TOR traffic passes through before it reaches its destination.\nBridges are TOR relays which are not publicly listed as part of the TOR network. Bridges are essential censorship-circumvention tools in countries that regularly block the IP addresses of all publicly listed TOR relays."
"TTL","Time To Live (TTL) represents the number of hops, or servers in different locations, the request can travel to before returning a failed attempt message." 
"URL/URI/URN","A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address of a specific webpage or file on the Internet.\nA Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) identifies the name and location of a file or resource in a uniform format.\nThe Uniform Resource Name (URN) are distinguished from URLs, which identify resources by specifying their locations in the context of a particular access protocol, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP)."
"UTC (GMT) (+0)","Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time."
"Virtual Machine (VM)","A Virtual Machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. VM’s are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination." 
"VPN","A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is 'tunneled' through a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet. By using encryption and other security measures, a VPN can scramble all the data sent through the wide area network, so the network is 'virtually' private."
"VPS","A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own OS and customers have superuser-level access to the OS to install any software that runs on that OS."
"Wi-Fi","Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows computers and other  devices to communicate over a wireless signal. It describes network components that are based on one of the 802.11 standards developed by the IEEE and adopted by the Wi-Fi Alliance."
"WEP vs WPA","Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol for Wi-Fi networks. Since wireless networks transmit data over radio waves, it is easy to intercept data or 'eavesdrop' on wireless data transmissions. The goal of WEP is to make wireless networks as secure as wired networks, such as those connected by Ethernet cables.\nWi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security protocol designed to create secure wireless networks. It is similar to the WEP protocol, but offers improvements in the way it handles security keys and the way users are authorized.\nFor an encrypted data transfer to work, both systems on the beginning and end of a data transfer must use the same encryption/decryption key. While WEP provides each authorized system with the same key, WPA uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which dynamically changes the key that the systems use. This prevents intruders from creating their own encryption key to match the one used by the secure network."
"Windows vs Microsoft","Windows is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft. Each version of Windows includes a graphical user interface, with a desktop that allows users to view files and folders in windows. For the past two decades, Windows has been the most widely used operating system for personal computers PCs." 
"x86 vs x64","x86 is the generic name for Intel processors released after the original 8086 processor. The 'x' stands for a range of possible numbers. This can run up to 32-bit compiled software and executables.\nx64, full name x86-64, is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set. It supports vastly larger amounts of virtual memory and physical memory than is possible on its 32-bit predecessors, allowing programs to store large amounts of data in memory."
